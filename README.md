# Aniget

A script which I am writing for me to watch animes without sities going down

## Requirements

- glibcc
- fzf

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Install the dependecies
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Make a anime directory in the same directory with anime-downloader

4. Run anime-downloader.py
    ```python3 anime-downloader.py```

or 

Run anime-downloader-rewrite.py for a cleaner menu (In developement still)
    ```python3 anime-downloader-rewrite.py```
This script will create a torrent file in the anime directory and download the files using your prefered torrent downloader

### Rewrite

I started the rewrite because I wanted to have a clean seach menu, the rewrite is going to take time because I am still learning
